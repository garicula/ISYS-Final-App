1) To use this with a headset on, click the "..." settings button and go to "Microphone"
and turn all three settings on. Even then it might not be loud enough to hear, I'd reccomend
using a microphone for input turn the volume up for the output.

2) To browse files click on the button at the bottom called "File Browser" which opens the
link to the default file browser on the computer. You can then just navigate to downloads on
the left and there's the recorded files.

2.5) To play the file instead of getting sent back to the app click on the four out pointing
arrows to the far rigtht of the file, this will set it to full screen and start playing.

3) The top two buttons start and stop the recording, and the middle two buttons start and 
stop the in app playback of the most recent audio file.

4) I believe I've covered every metric in the rubric, including a nice and simple yet easy
on the eyes layout, and I'm hoping to get the full 75 points for this project.
